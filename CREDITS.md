Consult their preserved notices and pinned sources for individual names and exact terms. This list does not replace those notices.

Development also used Microsoft Visual Studio/Windows SDK, LLVM/Clang, DirectX Shader Compiler, CMake, Ninja, Git, Python, Pillow and PowerShell. Earlier setup tooling used Go. These tools belong to their respective authors; not all development tools are distributed with the game.

OpenAI ChatGPT/Codex provided AI assistance for development, troubleshooting, documentation and generated/edited launcher artwork. This is disclosed as a development method, not as authorship of the original game or upstream technology. The maintainer is responsible for the decision to use it and for addressing defects and attribution issues.

Please report omissions or incorrect credit so the record can be corrected. No contributor's name should be used to imply their approval of this project or its AI-assisted changes.

## Included optional texture conversion

Road Rash 64 Remastered Edition was created by **Crisaty (Cristian A.T.)**. This package includes an **RT64 conversion of that original Jabo texture pack** for Road Rash 64 Recompiled. All credit for the original mod and artwork belongs to its creator; the recompilation project does not claim authorship of those textures or endorsement by the creator.

[Original creator and project page](https://crisaty.tumblr.com/post/113116999840/road-rash-64-remastered-edition)

The optional RTZ is in `optional-mods`. Install it through Settings > Mods. Replace an older copy rather than installing duplicates. The source ZIP does not include the texture pack. Attribution is not a redistribution license; no explicit redistribution license was found in the supplied pack or linked creator page.

## Native Linux contribution

CalenCyr contributed the Linux build, POSIX compatibility, FFmpeg audio decoding,
shutdown diagnosis and AppImage packaging work in PR #4. The contributor disclosed
substantial Claude AI assistance and reported Fedora and Steam Deck testing. This
experimental integration carries later Road Rash fixes and additional packaging
changes; that earlier testing does not establish acceptance of this binary.

## Optional MK64 course import

Mario Kart 64 and its original courses, artwork and audio belong to their original creators and rights holders. Importing uses the player's own supported ROM; the release does not include that ROM or the resulting course assets.

The importer uses the [n64decomp/mk64 project](https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64/tree/58cfcb022e10f83bc3b889d7e97508cae6837098), revision `58cfcb022e10f83bc3b889d7e97508cae6837098`, for course layouts, display-list and compression formats, collision, animation, path and audio behavior. Its contributors' work made the conversion possible. References include `libmio0`, `n64graphics`, the course/rendering code and the native audio sequencer. The motion helper adapts original path/spline routines; the contact helper uses selected translated Road Rash routines with N64Recomp support. No endorsement is implied, and these credits do not relicense original game code.

Course music and sound effects are rendered locally from the ROM's original sequences and instrument samples by the project's Python converter. It uses NumPy for sample processing; a separate MIDI converter or downloaded soundtrack is not required. The result approximates the original audio processing and is not a bit-exact N64 recording. The Linux player's FFmpeg custom-soundtrack decoder is a separate component, credited below.

| Importer component | Authors and contributors | Use |
|---|---|---|
| [Python](https://www.python.org/) | Guido van Rossum, Python Software Foundation and Python contributors | Portable conversion runtime |
| [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) | NumPy developers and contributors | Sample processing and numerical operations |
| [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS), LAPACK and GCC runtime | OpenBLAS contributors, LAPACK authors and Free Software Foundation contributors | Libraries included in the NumPy wheels; the Linux wheel also includes libquadmath |
| [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) | PyInstaller development team and contributors | Freezing the converter and its bootloader |
| [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/) | OpenSSL Project authors and contributors | Python's bundled cryptography/TLS libraries |
| [libffi](https://github.com/libffi/libffi) | Anthony Green, Red Hat and contributors | Python's foreign-function support |
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) | FFmpeg developers and contributors | Linux custom-soundtrack decoding; not part of MK64 course conversion |

Full importer runtime notices are in `tools/mk64-importer/licenses` in the Windows package and `usr/bin/tools/mk64-importer/licenses` inside the Linux AppImage, with supplemental notices in `licenses/mk64-importer`. The Linux runtime also credits the zlib and XZ Utils authors. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for versions and terms, and `scripts/MK64-IMPORTER-NOTICES.md` in the source package for build details. Original game developers, mod creators, upstream researchers and tool authors retain credit for their respective work.
